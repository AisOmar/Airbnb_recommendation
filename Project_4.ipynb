center of the universe  and was seattle s historic artsy neighborhood   it has since become home to a lot of high tech and has grown while still hanging onto it s roots   hey  we ve got a giant troll  an original giant soviet era statue of lenin  a cold war era rocket that lights up  and an almost life sized model of the planet saturn   who doesn t love saturn      fremont is a very safe neighborhood with many really good restaurants opening all the time   there are several live music venues that i d be happy to direct you towards   we ve got a fantastic organic grocery store a couple of blocks away  a gluten free bakery just down the street  and a belgian beer hall around the corner   there s america s first  and maybe still only   fair trade  organic chocolate factory   blocks away   they give tours for    every day and all the free samples you can ,because of confusion about my request not to come in and out the front way i have removed my actual address   the given address will get you to where you should be after which  if you follow the directions  you re about   feet away   if you need an address for your gps you can enter   fremont ave n   this is not my address but will get you to the corner of   and fremont ave n   follow the directions in from there  i want people to understand that this is a self contained unit but one that is connected to a house that creative people live in   there are bbq s and music and laughter   i sound proofed it pretty well so it s not noisy  but neither is this a quiet retreat   one of the housemates downstairs does some sound recording of local bands   contrary to what you might think  it s not loud but quite the opposite   when he s recording quiet tracks  we may ask you to try and not make any loud  banging sounds as the mics can pick them up   i m not talking about tip toeing around ,all kind of public transit runs through here   it s about a   minute bus ride to downtown from several bus stops  all within   or   blocks   you can sign up for   and just grab your own smartcar and pay by the minute   or  from here  you can just walk everywhere and use the bicycles for the longer trips  if it s between renting a car and using   i d totally go with the latter but  if you do have a car  parking isn t bad considering it s a dense urban neighborhood   just read the signs carefully as parking enforcement is ruthless   i d be happy to advise you on the  good spots  where you can just park your car and forget about it   of course  as in most cities  don t tempt thieves by leaving stuff lying around in your car  and also  remember  come and go out the back way   have i mentioned that yet</th>\n",
