# Recommendation engine for Airbnb users 

Datasets were scraped from Airbnb Seattle listing. I have three datasets:

- Calendar (includes dates, price, and avilibility for listings)
- Listing (all avialible information about the propery listing)
- Reviews (comments of a reviewer for all the listings)

## Steps: 

- do a sentiment analysis of reviews per listing 
- identify preferenced of a reviewers 
- create a rating for a house
- create clusters of different kinds of houses
- recommend airbnb listings that correlates for users preferences
